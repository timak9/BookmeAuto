# BookmeAuto

This Python script automates reservations for a specific date and time, enabling users to be among the first to register after a reservation window opens (such as the Technion system, which blocks reservations until 6 days before).

## Features
- Automatically registers reservations within 10 seconds of the window opening.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Run the Script**: Use Python to execute `bookme.py`.
3. **Provide Date/Time**: Input the desired reservation date and time in the script to automate the booking process
